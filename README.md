# Yelp Business Data Analysis

In this analysis,i used Yelp's business, reviews and user data. 
The data source is Kaggle which I downloaded first and uploaded back into a public s3 bucket: s3://sta9760-project2/yelp-dataset/*.json

* I performed entire project on AWS EMR. 
* EMR cluster was configured and I created PySpark notebook using this EMR cluster. 
* I used PySpark during the analysis.
